# AI Features Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Backend-Powered AI Integration with OpenRouter

Your SlideMaker application now includes powerful AI features that work seamlessly without requiring users to enter their own API keys. All AI requests are handled by your backend service using OpenRouter, which provides access to multiple AI models through a unified API.

## ðŸ“‹ Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Your OpenRouter API Key

1. Visit [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Sign up or log in to your account
3. Navigate to **Keys** section at [https://openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
4. Click **"Create Key"**
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-or-...`)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   ```

2. Edit `.env.local` and add your OpenRouter API key:
   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

### 3. Restart Your Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Ensure these environment variables are set in your production environment:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_production_openrouter_key
```

### Rate Limiting (Recommended)
Consider implementing rate limiting to control API usage:

```typescript
// Example rate limiting middleware
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const aiRateLimit = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 10, // limit each IP to 10 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many AI requests, please try again later.'
});
```

### Monitoring
Monitor your API usage through the OpenRouter dashboard to track:
- Request volume
- Token usage
- Costs across different models
- Error rates
- Model performance comparisons

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Generate a Single Slide

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"OpenRouter API key not configured"**
   - Check that `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
   - Restart your development server

2. **"Failed to generate content"**
   - Verify your OpenRouter API key is valid
   - Check your OpenRouter account has sufficient credits
   - Review server logs for detailed error messages
   - Try switching to a different model if one is unavailable

3. **Slow AI responses**
   - This is normal for AI generation (typically 3-10 seconds)
   - Consider adding loading indicators for better UX

### Debug Mode:
Enable detailed logging by adding to your `.env.local`:
```env
DEBUG=true
```

## ðŸ“Š Cost Management

### OpenAI Pricing (as of 2024):
- **GPT-3.5-turbo**: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- **Average slide generation**: ~500-1000 tokens
- **Estimated cost per slide**: $0.001-$0.002

### Cost Optimization Tips:
1. Use GPT-3.5-turbo instead of GPT-4 for cost efficiency
2. Implement caching for similar requests
3. Set reasonable token limits
4. Monitor usage through OpenAI dashboard
